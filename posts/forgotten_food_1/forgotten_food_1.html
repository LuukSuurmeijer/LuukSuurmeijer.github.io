            <p>
                I almost always take pictures of my food. If I eat in any
                company I am often asked, sometimes judgingly, whether I post
                these images on my social media. I do not, and I always answer
                that I am not really sure why I do it. I periodically scroll
                through my camera roll on my phone and try to remember the taste
                of the food and
                atmosphere at the restaurant. One of my friends <a
                    href="https://x.com/dietweeterei">@dietweeterei</a> once
                mentioned I could make a blog out of this reminiscing. Well,
                here we are.</p>
            <h2 id="headline-1">
                Split
            </h2>
            <p>
                This particular food (in the broad sense, as it's a drink) was
                had in 2018 in Split, Croatia. I was on holiday with my
                girlfriend at the time. It was my first holiday without my
                parents, so it was a little uncanny being able to pick a
                destination that was not Turkey or Greece. We landed on Croatia.
                My ex's non-negiotables included warm Mediterannean
                weather and mine included cheap cost of living, we were students
                after all (it is much later in the relationship that we'd
                find out how truly incompatible our
                ideas for a fulfilling vacation turned out to be). For now
                Croatia fit the bill.
            </p>
            <p>
                I didn't mind Split, but I also didn't care for it. I distinctly
                remember the pebbled beaches which hurt my feet. We frequented
                the 3 or so beaches easily accesible from the city, which were
                to me rather bland (truth be told, going to the beach in general
                can be rather bland). It was actually the area around Split that
                interested me the most and where the most beautiful sights there
                were to be seen. However, neither of us had a car (let alone a
                license) so we felt somewhat stuck in the city.

                The Old Town
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Old Town is were we spent a lot of our time. And on the
                square of the old town it was where we had this lemonade.
                Looking around the map I believe it to be at the <a
                    href="https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narodni_trg_u_Splitu#Izgled_i_povijest">The
                    People's Square</a>.
                I remember the square being beautiful, and having a nice
                atmosphere. It wasn't as packed with tourists as you might
                expect.
                I wanted a late vacation, in September after the school holidays
                had ended, because it would be much cheaper.
                This led to a disagreement between me and my girlfriend as she
                was worried the weather would not be as hot.

                I also was willing
                to make sacrifices, though.
                Our vacation was during the first week of the semester and this
                meant I would miss the first lecture of the C++ course I naively
                signed up for.
                Missing this lecture worried me a great deal, and I decided to
                review the slides one evening in our AirBnB. The review didn't
                take away my worries.
                If anything, doing this made them worse (do not under, any
                circumstance, think you should learn C++). Come to think of it,
                I was always worried about
                something on vacation as a student.
                Missing classes, upcoming deadlines, using a part of my student
                loans to pay for it. Matters that I was not able to let go
                whilst I was away. I am much better about that now!

                Right, the Drink
            </h2>
            <p>
                The things I remember about this drink are not so
                interesting. It was cold. My girlfriend had the lemon flavored
                drink and I had the orange flavored one. Very sweet. Around the
                time it was popular to serve drinks in containers that were not
                a glass, such as mason jars or screw bottles.

                Writing all this
                out brought up a lot of things about that time that I had
                forgotten.
                I guess the real reason I take pictures of food and drinks is to
                remember a part of my life, rather than anything about the
                taste? I think I'll keep doing it.
