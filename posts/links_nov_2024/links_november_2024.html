                A collection of some of the things I learned and some of the

                Self-Hosting Journey
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have a small PC connected to a TV-screen that I use to watch
                TV, because I thought this would work way better than a
                "SMART"-TV (and it does! I really don't know why you would buy
                an absolute shite product like that). I thought I could just use
                this computer to act as a server and use it to self-host a bunch
                of stuff at the cost of always having it on. I installed Ubuntu
                Server on it, so far I've got:

                <ul>
                    <li class="item"><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pihole</a>
                        for blocking ads on any device connected to my
                        network</li>
                    <li class="item"><a
                            href="https://www.wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a> as a
                        VPN tunnel so I can access my network from
                        anywhere.</li>
                    <li class="item">A shared folder with Samba for file
                        sharing. Using this for back-ups and photos as cloud
                        storage!</li>
                    <li>A little Docker container that scrapes interesting job
                        postings from indeed etc. and puts them in my Samba
                        share (code not on Github yet).</li>
                </ul>

                I hope to do a bunch of cool stuff with this in the future. Like
                hosting this website, having more useful containers running that
                automatically do stuff for me, and a place where I can host my
                machine learning projects.

            </p>

                    the word "key"? Key Insights, Key Takeaways, Key Points, Key

                <li class="item">People often say the 2-axis system (right-left,
                    progressive-conservative) is a much too simple system for

                    Netherlands, seeing that parties tend to fall on a straight
                    line, it looks like it's <a
